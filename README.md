# ðŸ”— OpenSchedulingLinkFinder

OpenSchedulingLinkFinder is a web-based Streamlit application designed to identify publicly accessible MYC Open Scheduling hyperlinks published by hospitals and health systems worldwide. The goal is to build a comprehensive dataset that reveals how different organizations implement open scheduling, what types of services are being offered, lead-times, analysis of adoption patterns, usability gaps, and digital front-door strategies. These insights can help inform the development of tools and best practices that improve patient access, reduce administrative burden, and support a more efficient, consumer-friendly healthcare experienceâ€”where the experience is frictionless, transparent, and accessible to all.

## Features
